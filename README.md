# Sensory Augmentation Device Project

## Overview
The Sensory Augmentation Device Project explores the use of haptic feedback to enhance human sensory perception, particularly in distance estimation. This research aims to investigate how different types of vibration feedback can augment an individual's ability to accurately perceive distances in various contexts.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the Arduino code used in the development of four iterations of the Sensory Augmentation Device. Each iteration represents a refinement in the design and functionality of the device, aiming to explore the most effective methods of sensory enhancement.


## Code Description
The Arduino code provided in this repository is designed to control the ultrasonic distance sensor and vibration motors (tactors) of the Sensory Augmentation Device. The code enables the device to measure distances and provide haptic feedback based on these measurements, assisting users in distance estimation tasks.

### Key Features
- **Distance Measurement**: Utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the device and an object.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Provides vibration feedback through tactors based on the measured distance.
- **Two Feedback Modes**: Includes both directional and non-directional feedback modes to compare their effectiveness in sensory augmentation.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Explore the potential of haptic feedback in enhancing human distance estimation abilities.
- Compare the effectiveness of directional versus non-directional feedback in sensory augmentation.
- Develop a prototype device that can be used in various experimental settings to gather data and insights.

## Getting Started
To use the code in this repository, you will need:
- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).
- An ultrasonic distance sensor.
- Vibration motors for haptic feedback.
- The Arduino IDE for uploading the code to the board.

### Setup and Usage
1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor and vibration motors to your Arduino board according to the circuit diagram provided.
2. Open the Arduino code file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
4. Test the device by placing it at different distances from objects to observe the haptic feedback.
